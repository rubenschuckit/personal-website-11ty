Of the limited coding I did in college, none of it was front end. So when I became a newly-minted software engineer in industry, front end coding was completely new to me. Like many software engineers (and [memes](https://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif)) attest, I find making templates and *especially* styling them with CSS very difficult and annoying. The people who can elegantly use CSS to create stunning layouts are the true geniuses of our time, and I'm afraid I can't count myself among them. Still, I've found myself incredibly fascinated by front end frameworks. 

I can't pinpoint why this is, especially since I never did any front end programming before my first job. But if I had to guess, it's because of Angular. Fresh out of college, I had few practical design skills besides being able to...well write code. And [Angular](https://angular.io/) was (and continues to be) and opinionated framework that forced me down a path of good design practice and as such was able to help me build my design intuition. 

I mention all this because Angular is a client side framework. And since I had no previous front end experience, it was not until leaving my previous job that I learned frameworks need not client side rendered. And this change has made me aware of the performance tradeoffs between client and server side rendering. But it also has let me notice an interesting pattern that has emerged. In the beginning, there was only server side rendering. Then client side rendering frameworks became the norm. And now client side frameworks are trying to become more server oriented.
