To get the full context of 2020, I need to go back to 2019. Don't worry, just to the day before. December 31, 2019. It was a cool evening night in Paris, and my family and I were dining at Brasserie Mollard to celebrate New Year's Eve. The restaurant was packed and busy. I distinctly remember how slowly the courses were coming out. But who cared? More time to chat and we wanted to be there when the first moments of 2020 came into existence. 

After a great meal, and celebrating entry into 2020, we stepped outside where it was somehow even more crowded. Everyone in Paris was celebrating. And to add to the chaos, a union strike meant reduced train services and road closures that bisected the city. One side of the city had all the cabs; the other had barely any. Guess which one we were in?

But things worked out, as they always did. As soon as I got back to the apartment we were staying at, I began some last-minute packing. I'd leave the next day. Weirdly enough, not the first time I've flown internationally on Jan 1st (the other was entering and not leaving Europe though). 

The next day I made my way through the Charles de Gaulle's futuristic yet impractical architecture to board my full flight. The previous day marked my last day in Paris, the last day of 2019, and the first time the Chinese Government alerted the WHO of a suspicious cluster of pneumonia cases.
