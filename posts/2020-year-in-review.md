To get the full context of 2020, I need to go back to 2019. Don't worry, just to the day before. December 31, 2019. It was a cool evening night in Paris, and my family and I were dining at Brasserie Mollard to celebrate New Year's Eve. The restaurant was packed and busy. I distinctly remember how slowly the courses were coming out. But who cared? More time to chat and we wanted to be there when the first moments of 2020 came into existence. 

After a great meal, and celebrating entry into 2020, we stepped outside where it was somehow even more crowded. Everyone in Paris was celebrating. And to add to the chaos, a union strike meant reduced train services and road closures that bisected the city. One side of the city had all the cabs; the other had barely any. Guess which one we were in?

But things worked out, as they always do. As soon as I got back to the apartment we were staying at, I began some last-minute packing. I'd leave the next day. Weirdly enough, not the first time I've flown internationally on Jan 1st (the other was entering and not leaving Europe though). 

The next day I made my way through Charles de Gaulle's futuristic yet impractical architecture to board my full flight. The previous day marked my last day in Paris, the last day of 2019, and the first time the Chinese Government alerted the WHO of a suspicious cluster of pneumonia cases.

What followed was completely unexpected and caught everyone off guard. Little did I know the congested and cramped environs of Paris that I had just experienced would be viewed as an existential threat months later. 

I don't remember the first time I heard or learned about the Coronavirus. But I do remember wondering to myself, as I listened to *Up First* on my packed Chicago L car, how long it had been since the Coronavirus had not been mentioned in a story every day. As I chatted about it with my friends, I remember exclaiming, "I'm not worried at all given how packed the L is every day." But at the same time I remember only using one hand on the bars during my train ride and keeping the other free for my phone to prevent crossover of germs. In the early term, I didn't see it as a threat. No one did. I didn't know how pandemics worked. I thought that since China was taking drastic and draconian measures to cordon off the epicenter, we would be safe in the US. Obviously that's not how it played out.

Still, there were other big changes in store. I had decided to switch jobs to Google. As my start date grew nearer, cities around the country began issuing shelter in place warnings. My last week at JPMorgan turned out being remote. Most of my belongings were stuck in the Chicago Chase Tower skyscraper. But not only was my last week remote, so was my first at Google.

# Leaving Chicago

My departure from Chicago was delayed to say the least. My first day at Google was in late April. I was able to extend my lease until the end of July, at which point I moved into one of Google's corporate apartments in Chicago until they unfroze relocations. 

I found it *especially* difficult to leave my apartment and neighborhood. As a renter, I never developed a sense of equity in the place and knew clearly that I would not be there forever. But leaving forced me to confront the fact that I had built a *home* there. In college I stayed in a different apartment every year, so really my stay in that apartment was the longest duration I had lived in one place since my childhood home, which I had not lived in for 6 years. 

But my fixation on my apartment was merely a symptom of a broader feeling. The feeling of moving on. After looking at my blank apartment after the movers finished, I couldn't help but harken back to the first time I viewed that apartment in an identical state. And it felt like my years there had been erased. That my time spent there had been reset so that the next tenant could build what I built there. And of course this is the case, in order for the space to feel my own there couldn't be a semblance of the previous tenants. 

But again, I fixated on my apartment because it was an easy target. The same could be said for how I felt about leaving Chicago. Moving out of my apartment is such a permanent act, and it forced me to confront that this chapter of my life was closing. And it forced me to confront that, Chicago no longer being the dominant chapter, that memory would begin to fade. Just as previous parts of my life began to fade into the distance. And although this is a necessary prerequisite for being in a position to create chapters we look back fondly on in the first place, being in the corporate apartment in a new neighborhood in Chicago prevented the new chapter from being written. I had finished one chapter and instead of being able to start the new one I was stuck merely writing the new chapter's name in the table of contents and writing nothing more.
