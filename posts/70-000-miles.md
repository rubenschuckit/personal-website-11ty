2022 was the year of travel. After COVID brought on sharp declines in people venturing outside of their homes, global travel trends this year have returned to 80% of their previous peaks. On a more personal note, my individual travel trends have returned to what feels like 1000% of its previous peak. This year I have traveled more than I ever have in any year, and in doing so I racked up a record-breaking number of newly-visited countries. This year saw big mileage gains in other mediums too (more on that later!), as well as other exciting progressions that can’t be measured in units of distance.

Let’s start by reviewing this year’s resolutions 🌈

* Turn 26 ✅
* Bike a century ✅
* Visit 3 national parks ⁉️
* Maintain my friendships and make new ones ✅
* Visit Chicago and NYC ✅
* Travel internationally (London and/or Israel) 🔥

This year I effortlessly continued to age, biked 100 miles, maintained friends and made new ones, and visited Chicago, NYC, as well as many many countries. 

So, did I visit 3 national parks? Er…maybe. I visited Yosemite (my strongest candidate), as well as The Banias in Israel (I never said three U.S. National Parks!). And for the third? Well, I visited Alcatraz. Technically a National Park…but let’s face it, not in the spirit of the resolution. So I think I’ll mark this one as incomplete. 

But as Thomas Jefferon said, “He who accomplishes all his goals is neither learning nor growing.”

In the interest of full disclosure, Thomas Jefferon did not say that, and I made up the quote. But the sentiment, I believe, is true. I didn’t quite smash this resolution, but in doing so I pushed myself to try new things. And in the end, isn’t that what is important? Yes. Ok, moving on.

# C﻿OVID

For this year’s review, I’d like to first address what past Ruben would be most curious about: COVID. Spoiler: You get it. Even so, this year saw me receiving just one COVID booster, representing a 75% YoY decline in jabs. To calculate the YoY decline in cases is more difficult, however. And this is difficult even if I had the patience to crunch the numbers since many (if not most) cases are discovered with rapid over-the-counter antigen tests that aren’t officially recorded anywhere. These readily available tests are a big improvement over the testing situation of the previous year, but perhaps most shockingly most people don’t really follow case numbers anymore. 

The NYT has removed the COVID counts from the top of its homepage, and more personally I’ve stopped keeping track, which is a big departure from my laser-focussed attention to them last year. I would say people’s attitudes this year have been forged by a strong desire to want to move on, difficulty coming to terms with the lack of control we have over the virus, and an understanding that for most people the virus is something that can be recovered from. 

# W﻿ork

Mandatory return to office (RTO) did occur (something I asked about in last year’s post). And it occurred rather abruptly. In March of this year, a single email went out saying that we would be required to return to the office in a month. I’ve been going into the office 4 days a week since it reopened in 2021, so this was business as usual for me. But I was still caught a little off guard by the announcement. There was always this loosely formed expectation in my mind that RTO wouldn’t occur until COVID was “under control.” But as it turns out, there is no such thing. 

The RTO announcement was one of the last big remaining obstacles of returning to the old normal, and so its announcement represented a lot as it pushed us into the next phase of the pandemic. Nevertheless, RTO was not strictly enforced. Most team’s attendances definitely steadily increased as the months of 2022 passed by, but Google’s so-called “hybrid work week” of 3 days in office is merely a suggestion it turns out. Perhaps just as I wondered about RTO last year, I will wonder for 2023 whether RTO starts becoming more than a suggestion–especially since this year saw the NASDAQ drop by one third. 

Otherwise work has been great. I switched teams this year to a Search Infrastructure team working on rendering and other frontend things. It was a very difficult decision to leave my previous team, but I can report that it was well worth it. I miss my old team and the work we did, but this new team aligns very closely with my interests. It’s a somewhat specialized area that doesn’t really exist at other companies since most rely on open source frameworks for their frontends. To be able to work in this space is very exciting and I look forward to continuing on the new team in the new year.

# T﻿ravel

Normally I divide my blog post into different themes and provide some insights and thoughts on each topic. This year, I’d like to try something a little different. I’ll be walking through each month of the year, since each month featured a part of my travels. I think this is the only true way to fully describe what the year was like. We’ll start in February, however, since January–notably–was the only month I spent at home. 

## February 

In February, Lauren and I went to the East Coast to visit Providence and NYC. 

I had never been to Providence before, and it was a blast. We got to walk around Lauren’s alma mater Brown, stay with her awesome friend Arushi, and visit the mansions in Newport. And of course, a little bit of ice skating.

From Providence we took the train down to NYC to visit Leah. It was great to catch up with Leah during her busy time in Law School. We also got to meet up with another one of Lauren’s awesome friends, Anna, who came down from New Haven. We went to the first of two museums on a ship I would go to this year–the Intrepid Museum on the Hudson River–and I visited Google NYC.
