Normally, when I set out to write these, I first start by thinking of what was different from the previous year. After looking back at last year, and reexamining this year,  I can honestly say this year has been much of the same. Now, normally such a categoriztion would be met with disappointment or be evidence of a rut. But the year before this one was a remarkable year! In 2022, I visited six countries, biked a century, and visited friends all over the country. With pride and no remorse I say: This year much the same! 

# And so it begins
The universe and I have decided to colocate most of my annual traditions with the start of our calendar year. The year always starts off strong and busy with the first month and a half containing my birthday, my anniversary, and Lauren's birthday. 

My birthday was a memorable affair. Lauren made delicious cupcakes for me to take to work. (A bit of free advice to my readers: by taking in a birthday bake to work, you can remind everyone it's your birthday without having to outright tell everyone.) 

She also made a delicious "trick" cake that had a surprise in the middle. I enjoyed sharing my birthday with Catie's boyfriend Zach as well!
