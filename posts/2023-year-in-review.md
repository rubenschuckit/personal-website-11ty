Normally, when I set out to write these, I first start by thinking of what was different from the previous year. After looking back at 2022, and re-examining 2023,  I can honestly say this year has been much of the same. Normally such a classification would be met with disappointment or be evidence of a rut. But the year before this one was a remarkable year! In 2022 I visited six countries, biked a century, and visited friends all over the country. With pride and no remorse I say: This year much the same! 

# A Photo is Worth 365 Days
I did something new with respect to mapping out my year. I bought a wall calendar! The [70,000 miles](/posts/70000-miles-2022-year-in-review/) of travel in 2022 made me realize that it was really hard to keep track of what was going to happen and when. 

The calendar was met with some skepticism from outside observers. It wasn't attractive decor per se, but it did prove incredibly useful! We had fun "penciling" in events and trips, and it helped me organize what was coming up. And now, as I stand at the end of the year, it helps reflect on what happened. 

In fact, the calendar proved to be so popular that it is getting a big upgrade for 2024. Stay tuned to the end to learn more about that.

# And so it begins
The universe and I have decided to group most annual traditions at the start of the calendar year. The year always starts off strong and busy with the first month and a half containing my birthday, my anniversary, and Lauren's birthday. 

My birthday was a memorable and good one. Lauren made delicious cupcakes for me to take to work. (A bit of free advice to my readers: by taking in a birthday bake to work, you can remind everyone it's your birthday without having to outright say it.) 

She also made a delicious "trick" cake that had a surprise in the middle. I enjoyed sharing my birthday with Catie's boyfriend Zach as well!

For Lauren's birthday, we ate at her favorite Indian restaurant and then went to an escape room. We ended up escaping with only one second to spare. The faciliatotrs said they've never seen that before! But hey, a win is a win!  

# COVID 
Each year that it's been around, I've commented on COVID during the preceeding year. Last year I got it, and...this year I didn't! 

We really do seem to be emerging from the pandemic, which is good news. I certainly wore my mask less and less this past year (still putting it on in super crowded locations) and managed to not contract it. 

Unfortunately, the lessening prevelance is mostly due to building up immunity the old-fashioned way and undoubtly some luck during the cold and flu season. Luckily a booster came out right before winter (and Lauren's and my trip to NYC and a crowded wedding).

Still, it's hard to forget the disruption, suffering, and excess deaths the pandemic has brought and the risk it poses to those still susceptible. And we're starting to hear of more and more people getting sick as the colder months cotinue on for a few more months, so always best to be careful!  

# Moving 4,000 Feet
Lauren and I moved into an awesome new home in Mountain View right off of the downtown. Having previously lived in Mountain View, the new home is a mere 4,000 feet away from the first one (as the crow flies).

The home is a spectacular find, with all credit going to Lauren. It's a prime location on a quiet street a close walk from restaurants. And it's a super unique setup with two floors! And on top of that all, it was (shockily) competively priced. 

The move was pretty smooth. We had super friendly and efficient movers who did a great job, and Lauren was instrumental in helping me pack. I still remember our first night when Lauren, her sisters, their boyfriends, and I sat on the floor in the living room eating pizza. It was nice to forget about all the unpacking to be done ahead. 

# The First 1/3 of the Year
In March, a happy coincidence occurred. My friend Eli was trasniting through the Bay and added a long layover for his flight from Taipei allowing him to stay with me. Meanwhile, my other friend Stella was visiting the Bay for an academic conference. So we got the gang back together! The last time the three of us were together was in November 2019 when Eli and I took a trip to Boston to visit Stella at MIT. 

The next month I paid homage to my college days by going to St. Louis for my 5th Reunion. It was fun to take Lauren there and show her the sights. 

There was a little weather, however, in the form of a Torando Watch. The last time I experienced a Tornado Watch in St. Louis was the first week of freshman year, so I definitely succeeded at reliving my early college days, which--let's face it--is what Reunion is all about anyway. 

# The Second 1/3 of the Year
This blog post has gone on long enough--it's time for a new country! 

Lauren's and my first international trip tested our packing skills to the max.
